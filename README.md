# Advent of Code JS
An app with solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Folder structure
Solutions to the Advent of Code challenges are located in the folder `/app/solutions/` with the following structure:

```plaintext
./app/solutions
├── /2024                        # Each year will have its own folder
    ├── /1                       # Each challenge day will have its own folder
        ├── page.tsx             # (Required) The page component
        ├── solution-part1.tsx   # See solution code files section
        ├── solution-part2.tsx   # See solution code files section
        ├── other files          # As required
```

## Solution code files
The solution code files are written in TypeScript and are located in the same folder as the page component. They are important as they are used in build scripts to generate the code snippets used for displaying code on the application.

These code snippets are also used to derive the list of solutions displayed on the main page.

### Naming convention
The solution code file should follow the format:

```
solution-part#.tsx
```

where `#` is the part number which the solution code file is for.

### Content
Solution code files are TypeScript files that export a function that returns the answer to the challenge. It can then be imported into the page component and subsequently called to retrieve the answer.

It is recommended for the file to only include the main logic for solving the challenge.

If there are any additional code needed by the solution code file, they can just be placed in a separate file and then imported.

### Build script
There are prebuild scripts in the project that copies these specific solution code files to the `/components/solution-details/code` folder. This is what allows the `SolutionDetails` component to display the code. There is no need to manually copy the files over.

After the build script runs, the code snippets will be available in the `/components/solution-details/code` folder.

```plaintext
./app
├── /solutions
│   ├── /2024                                # Each folder will be copied
│       ├── /1                               # Each folder will be copied
│           ├── solution-part1.tsx           # Copied and renamed
│           ├── solution-part2.tsx           # Copied and renamed
│           ├── other files                  # Not copied
├── /components
    ├── /solution-details
        ├── /code
            ├── /2024
                ├── /1
                    ├── solution-part1.txt
                    ├── solution-part2.txt
```

### SolutionDetails component
The [`SolutionDetails`](app/components/solution-details.tsx#L8) component is used to display the answer to a specific challenge as well as display a code snippet that was used to derive the answer. It looks for the code snippets for a particular challenge in the `/components/solution-details/code` folder.

> **NOTE:** When displaying the code, `import`, `export`, and type definition statements (`type`, `interface`, `enum`) are automatically stripped off.

> **IMPORTANT:** The solution code files should not contain any sensitive information, as they will be displayed on the application.

### Solutions list
The list of solutions displayed on the main page is derived from the generated code snippets. The list is generated by reading the contents of the `/components/solution-details/code` folder.

Each folder represents a year, each subfolder represents a challenge day, and each code snippet represents a star which serves as an indicator of the number of parts completed for that challenge.

## Debugging
1. Start the application with server debugging enabled by running `npm run debug`.
2. Navigate to the application from the browser.
3. Open a new tab on the browser and navigate to the `chrome://inspect` page.
4. Click on the `inspect` link on the `chrome://inspect` page to open the DevTools for the server.
5. Add breakpoints to the server code and start debugging.

If the `inspect` link is not available, click the `Configure...` button on the `chrome://inspect` page then add the server address. The details can be found on the console output when the server starts. Look for the text `"the Next.js router server should be inspected at [port]"`.

## Advent of Code session

The application requires a session cookie to be able to fetch the challenge data from the Advent of Code website.

To get the session cookie:
1. Navigate to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Open the browser's developer tools.
4. Go to the `Application` tab and expand the `Cookies` section.
5. Copy the value of the `session` cookie.
